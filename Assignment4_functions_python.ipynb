        "- In Python, parameters are the variable names listed in a function’s definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when called.

Use positional, keyword, or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs). Methods are called on objects. Recursive and nested functions are also valid forms of definition and invocation."

This allows functions to produce outputs that can be stored in variables, used in expressions, or passed to other functions for further processing."

        "Generators in Python are special functions that return an iterator using the yield keyword instead of return. They produce values one at a time, pausing between each, which saves memory. Defined like normal functions, generators are ideal for large data processing, as they generate values lazily when iterated."

        "Generators save memory by yielding values one at a time, unlike regular functions that return all values at once. They support lazy evaluation, making them ideal for large datasets or infinite sequences. Generators also improve performance and reduce overhead, as they maintain state between calls without storing all data."

Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations, especially as arguments in functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), where defining a full function is unnecessary."
